# Doing Data Science from Scratch

## Introduction
This project shows three different analyses done on a series of datasets. 
Each dataset was chosen based on educational purposes for the _AI Techniques Course_ as part of the **M.Sc. in Visual Analytics and Big Data**

## Implemented Technologies
In this project, I use Python as the programming language for making the data analyses, the python code runs on Jupyter Notebooks environment, 
and some of the most famous libraries for data analysis and ML in Python are used like Scikit-learn, Matplotlib Pandas, Keras and TensorFlow.

## Analyses Description
### Analysis 1
In the first analysis, we explore a car dataset with the goal of training the best classification  model, 
in this case, we’re comparing two classification models `(CART and Random Forest)` based on their Confusion Matrix Metrics

### Analysis 2
In the second scenario, we will compare neural networks applied to classification and regression problems against classical ML Techniques 
and conclude which ML techniques are better for each case. 

### Analysis 3
In the third and final analysis, we’ll dive into the dataset provided by the [European Union]( https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/covid-19-coronavirus-data/?locale=en) 
and we’ll assist a fictitious scenario where we were hired to analyze the global impact of the coronavirus, 
for this purpose we’ll try to prove if coronavirus deaths are related with other risk factors and we’ll using a dataset 
provided by the [WHO](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.INADEQUATEWSH?lang=en) as a complement for our main dataset. 
In this case, we’re going to focus on the risk factor of **Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation, and lack of hygiene** . 
The ML techniques applied in this case will be clustering techniques since there isn’t any previous classification between deaths and having 
coronavirus and being exposed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation, and lack of hygiene.
